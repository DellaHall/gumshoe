This is just my trying to teach myself C++ by writing a simple game. It's still in very, very early stages.
I'm drawing inspiration from a classic DOS game of my youth, [Sleuth](https://archive.org/details/SleuthAMurderMystery_1020).
I'm using SFML as my game engine, and writing the maps with Tiled.
